<h2 id="how-marks-are-awarded">How marks are awarded</h2>
<p>As per the course outline, project marks themselves are split between the deliverable components.</p>
<p>The completed eCommerce project itself is worth 40% of your final mark for the project course.&nbsp; Each team member earns the same mark for this component.</p>
<p>The other 60% of your final mark is based entirely on your personal contribution to the project.</p>
<p>Please see the breakdown below:</p>
