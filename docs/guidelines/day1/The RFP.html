<h2 id="capabilities-demonstration">Capabilities Demonstration</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Our company (WDD Development) has been asked to demonstrate its capabilities in developing eCommerce solutions. A local marketing firm, XYZ Marketing, has acquired a number of recent clients who are looking to develop eCommerce websites or web Applications. XYZ is primarily a communications and design studio, and has no wish to build an in-house programming/development department. As a result, XYZ is looking to partner with a local firm in handling their clients needs.</p>
<p>Our firm has been shortlisted, along with two others. We have already shared our capabilities document with XYZ, but the management team has agreed that we would like to put together at two to three eCommerce solutions to act as live examples of our capabilities. As a result, we have created internal teams comprising our top developers (you) to handle this.</p>
<p>Each team is being asked to develop a modern, fully functioning eCommerce solution. Each solution should demonstrate our capabilities as a full-stack development studio. Although it is most likely that XYZ would provide some of these services when outsourcing to us, we feel it is important to demonstrate our own in-house capabilities in each area:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Planning</li>
<li>Graphic Design</li>
<li>Data Modelling and database management</li>
<li>UI/UX design</li>
<li>Server deployment and setup</li>
<li>Front end coding and programming</li>
<li>Back end programming and coding</li>
<li>Team/Distributed work capability</li>
<li>Git usage</li>
<li>Professionalism in all aspects of our work</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-teams">2. The Teams</h3>
<p>Each team comprises individuals who, combined, have all the skills required to create a great project. Please keep in mind, that there may be a wide range of skills and interests among team members; it is the purpose of this project to show that all team members can contribute to their full capabilities to any project they are assigned to. Teams will be announced in the kickoff meeting.</p>
<h3 id="the-project">2. The project</h3>
<p>We are asking each team to come up with a project idea. Your project may revolve around a single product type, or multiple product types. Your project may be a social selling site (think ebay), or it may be for an imaginary online retailer. Whatever type of project you come up with, you will need to meet the following requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully planned and explained in a proposal/memo</li>
<li>Original graphic design (prior to coding HTML)</li>
<li>Modern, responsive, valid HTML5 and CSS3</li>
<li>Fully normalized data model (3NF)</li>
<li>Database implemented in MySQL</li>
<li>Javascript integration</li>
<li>Back end programming in PHP</li>
<li>Use of a backend MVC framework</li>
<li>Version control using Git and Git workflow for branching, pull requests, merges, etc</li>
<li>Deployment on a fully provisioned remote server (client will provide server)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: Before beginning ANY work or planning, please explain your idea to your supervisor (me) to get it approved.</strong></p>
<h3 id="proposal">3. Proposal</h3>
<p>You must write a full proposal (<strong>internal document, not for outside consumption</strong>), so that management can approve and/or provide feedback prior to the beginning of work.</p>
<p>We have put together an outline of the proposal you should put together. Please don’t feel the need to invest too much time creating a designed, formatted document as we would for a client. This is an internal document, for internal use only.&nbsp; It should be created using markdown, allowing all team members to contribute their section in text, using Git.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Introduction - briefly describe the project you would like to create and how it meets our needs</li>
<li>Project details - outline the functionality you intend to develop (both front and back end), in detail</li>
<li>Propose design solution - Exports of your PSDs/Figma/Sketch files showing your proposed design… at least three pages please: home, list, detail and perhaps a generic page</li>
<li>User Personas/Use Case diagrams or statements - Describe each type of user your application can accommodate… eg: guest, authenticated, editor, contributor, admin, etc. Describe how each type of user can interact with the site… walk through a typical session of each one.</li>
<li>Sitemaps - Detailed sitemaps for front end and back end (admin) sides, showing all possible pages</li>
<li>Server - Describe your server setup in detail (version, flavour), software installed, etc</li>
<li>Security - Describe steps you have taken or intend to take to implement security at the server level, but also at the application level… for example, how do you intend to handle the usual Web application vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF and MySQL injection?</li>
<li>Database - Create a detailed data model (ERD) in appropriate software showing all tables, all relationships, all fields, and all data types.</li>
<li>Value Adds - think of some value adds that you or your team is uniquely capable of adding to this project… how can we over-deliver so that we can impress XYZ with our capabilities and planning?</li>
<li>Revised ERD for your Value Adds… if your value adds result in changes to your data model, please explain and provide a revised ERD</li>
<li>Your team - Come up with a catchy team name, and list your team members, and the areas in which they will most likely make a significant contribution.</li>
</ol>
