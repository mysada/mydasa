<p>There are many services that allow you to organize team work, assign work, etc.</p>
<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<p>BitBucket and Github both support issues. You can simply use this built in functionality to assign work to team members. Once completed, the team member simply mentions the issue number in their commit message, and Bitbucket or Github will automatically associate a commit/pull-request to a specific issue.</p>
<h2 id="trello">Trello</h2>
<p>Trello is an easy to use system that allows you to setup Kanban boards. Team members can join the board, be assigned work, and the project manager can easily move items along the board line from ‘To Do’ to ‘Completed’.</p>

<p>Trello is owned by Atlassian (the same people who own Bitbucket), so it integrates easily into BitBucket and becomes a menu option in the repository once you link a board to a repository.</p>
<h2 id="jira">Jira</h2>
<p>There are a variety of other services that offer similar services. The most famous, and probably the most widely used in the industry, is Jira (but it can be hard to learn and is a bit complex). Jira is also owned by Atlassian/</p>

<h2 id="asana">Asana</h2>
<p>Asana is a good alternative that offers some nice features, including generation of assignment codes that can be used as branch names, easily connecting commits and pull-requests to items on the board.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>
<p>Or, find your own alternative.&nbsp; It's not a project requirement to use a project management service, but it’s definitely a good idea to use some kind of service to track your work and make sure things are always moving forward.</p>
